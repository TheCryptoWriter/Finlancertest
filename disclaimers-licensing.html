                        <li>This is an agreement between Licensor (“FIN Compliance - Lancer) and Licensee (“User”),
                            who is being
                            licensed to use the named Software (“FIN Lancer).</li><br>

                        <li>Licensee acknowledges that this is only a limited nonexclusive license. Licensor is and
                            remains the owner of all
                            titles, rights, and interests in the Software.</li><br>

                        <li>This License permits Licensee to install the Software on more than one computer system, as
                            long as the Software
                            will not be used on more than one computer system simultaneously. Licensee will not make
                            copies of the Software,
                            forms, checklists, or allow copies of the Software to be made by others, unless authorized
                            by this License
                            Agreement. Licensee may make copies of the Software for backup purposes only.</li><br>

                        <li>This Software is subject to a limited warranty. Licensor warrants to Licensee that the
                            physical medium on which
                            this Software is distributed is free from defects in materials (not including system bug
                            fixes) and workmanship
                            under normal use, the Software will perform according to its printed documentation, and to
                            the best of
                            Licensor's knowledge. Licensee's use of this Software according to the printed documentation
                            is not an
                            infringement of any third party's intellectual property rights. This limited warranty lasts
                            for a period of 30
                            days after delivery. To the extent permitted by law, THE ABOVE-STATED LIMITED WARRANTY
                            REPLACES ALL OTHER
                            WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING ANY
                            IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
                            TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. No agent of
                            Licensor is
                            authorized to make any other warranties or to modify this limited warranty. Any action for
                            breach of this
                            limited warranty must be commenced within one year of the expiration of the warranty.
                            Because some jurisdictions
                            do not allow any limit on the length of an implied warranty, the above limitation may not
                            apply to this
                            Licensee. If the law does not allow disclaimer of implied warranties, then any implied
                            warranty is limited to 30
                            days after delivery of the Software to Licensee. Licensee has specific legal rights pursuant
                            to this warranty
                            and, depending on Licensee's jurisdiction, may have additional rights.</li><br>

                        <li>In case of a breach of the Limited Warranty, Licensee's exclusive remedy is as follows:
                            Licensee will return all
                            copies of the Software to Licensor, at Licensee's cost, along with proof of purchase.
                            (Licensee can obtain a
                            step-by-step explanation of this procedure, including a return authorization code, by
                            contacting Licensor at
                            2950 Buskirk Avenue, Suite #300, Walnut Creek, CA 94591 or (650) 305-2688.) At Licensor's
                            option, Licensor will
                            either send Licensee a replacement copy of the Software, at Licensor's expense, or issue a
                            full refund.</li><br>

                        <li>Notwithstanding the foregoing, LICENSOR IS NOT LIABLE TO LICENSEE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING
                            COMPENSATORY,
                            SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, CONNECTED WITH OR
                            RESULTING FROM THIS
                            LICENSE AGREEMENT OR LICENSEE'S USE OF THIS SOFTWARE. Licensee's jurisdiction may not allow
                            such a limitation of
                            damages, so this limitation may not apply.</li><br>

                        <li>Licensee agrees to defend and indemnify Licensor and hold Licensor harmless from all claims,
                            losses, damages,
                            complaints, or expenses connected with or resulting from Licensee's business operations.
                        </li><br>


                        <li>Licensor has the right to terminate this License Agreement and Licensee's right to use this
                            Software upon any
                            material breach by Licensee.</li><br>


                        <li>Licensee agrees to return to Licensor or to destroy all copies of the Software upon
                            termination of the License.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>Licensee is responsible for protecting and safeguarding any passwords, user IDs or other
                            credentials and login information (collectively, &quot;Passwords&quot;) that have been
                            provided to
                            Licensee or that are generated in connection with Licensee’s use of the Subscription
                            Services.
                            Licensee will not disclose or make available Passwords other than to Users and will use best
                            efforts to prevent unauthorized access to, or use of, the Passwords or the Subscription
                            Services. Licensee is fully responsible for all activities that occur in connection with the
                            Passwords. Licensee will immediately notify RIA Review (via email, writing, or telephone) of
                            any
                            unauthorized use of the Subscription Services that comes to Licensee’s attention.</li><br>
                        <li>This License Agreement is the entire and exclusive agreement between Licensor and
                            Licensee regarding this Software. This License Agreement replaces and supersedes all prior
                            negotiations, dealings, and agreements between Licensor and Licensee regarding this
                            Software.</li><br>
                        <li> This License Agreement is governed by the law of California.</li><br>
                        <li>This License Agreement is valid without Licensor&#39;s signature. It becomes effective
                            upon the
                            earlier of Licensee&#39;s signature or Licensee&#39;s use of the Software.</li><br>
